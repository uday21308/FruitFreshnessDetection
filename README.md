As part of the Mobile Application Development course at Amrita School of Computing, we developed Fruit Freshness Detection app, an AI-powered app focused on a fruit’s freshness detection through a fruit’s image using the ML model. The app focuses on monitoring fruit freshness using computer vision and machine learning, assessing factors like color, texture, and ripeness for accurate freshness detection.
Our project utilizes the Kaggle  dataset to train several deep learning models, including CNN, ResNet, SVM, VGG16 and DenseNet. Testing revealed that DenseNet provided the highest accuracy at 96%, followed closely by ResNet at 95% then by VGG-16 at 94% then by SVM 92% and then by CNN 89%.
